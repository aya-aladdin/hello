		<h4 style="text-align:center; background-color:pink;">i finally did it</h4>
		<p> anyways, heres a story:</p>
		<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
		<p>Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and ancient forests, there lived a young girl named Lila. Lila was known for her insatiable curiosity and her love for exploring the unknown. Every day after school, she would venture into the woods, her trusty satchel filled with a notebook, a pencil, and a small lantern.</p>

		<p>One misty afternoon, as Lila wandered deeper into the forest than ever before, she stumbled upon a hidden glen. The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the sound of a gentle stream. At the center of the glen stood a grand oak tree, its branches stretching towards the sky, adorned with leaves that shimmered like emeralds.</p>

		<p>Intrigued, Lila approached the tree and noticed a small, ornate door carved into its trunk. Without hesitation, she opened the door and stepped inside, finding herself in a dimly lit tunnel that seemed to spiral downward. She followed the path, her lantern casting flickering shadows on the walls.</p>

		<p>After what felt like hours, Lila emerged into a breathtaking underground cavern. Glowing crystals adorned the walls, casting a soft, magical light over everything. At the center of the cavern, a serene lake mirrored the crystals' glow, creating a dazzling display of colors.</p>

		<p>As she gazed in awe, a soft voice called out, "Welcome, Lila." Startled, she turned to see a small creature with large, luminous eyes and delicate wings hovering nearby. "I am Lumina, the guardian of this hidden realm. You have been chosen to be its protector."</p>

		<p>Lila's heart swelled with excitement and pride. "What must I do?" she asked.</p>

		<P>"Simply keep the secret of this place safe and visit often to ensure its beauty remains undisturbed," Lumina replied with a gentle smile.</p>

		<p>From that day on, Lila visited the hidden glen and its magical cavern regularly, tending to the plants, polishing the crystals, and keeping the secret of its existence. She grew up knowing that some mysteries are meant to be cherished and preserved, not for the world to see, but for the heart to hold dear.</p>

		<p>And so, the hidden glen remained a place of wonder, its magic protected by the love and care of a curious girl who became its lifelong guardian.</p>
